This Discord bot is fully-functional AI chatbot integrated into Discord, the popular chat service that is primarily used in gaming circles. This github version has a lot of keys and api info removed.

Using OpenAI's API, it communicates with OpenAI to produce GPT-4.1 and soon GPT-5 responses, or produce images using DALLE-3. There are token limits and other coding implementations designed to help the bot integrate into the Discord environment seemlessly. The bot is hosted on Pebblehost for its friendly services tailored to hosting such bots.

One of the bot's most useful features for large servers is allowing users to automatically select roles they are interested in. For example, a user can click below and select which games they are interested in (or not):
<img width="534" height="254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39a23f2-3350-4b42-9032-23f50fe2b21f" />

Below is a basic inteaction between a user and the bot. The bot in this case is prompted to act like a cat who likes cat puns.

Requesting image creation is also possible, and will be updated to GPT-Image-1 in the near future.

There are also other non-AI features such as requesting an image of a staring cat for judging other users, or asking for basic public server info.

This is was my first major project in JavaScript, and I used a fair bit of resources to understand the asynchronous programing that I then applied here. I'm sure in hindsight there's a lot I could've done better, but for a first major attempt I'm quite happy with this project. Perhaps a major revamp is in the works in the future.
